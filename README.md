# LSTM-next-word-predictor
This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network trained on Shakespeare's Hamlet. It uses the TensorFlow Keras API to build and train the model and Streamlit to provide an interactive web-based interface for users to input a text sequence and get the predicted next word.
